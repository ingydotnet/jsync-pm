NAME
    JSYNC - JSON YAML Notation Coding

SYNOPSIS
        use JSYNC;

        my $object = <any perl expression>
        my $jsync = JSYNC::dump($object, {pretty => 1});
        $object = JSYNC::load($jsync);

DESCRIPTION
    JSYNC is an extension of JSON that can serialize any data objects.

STATUS
    This is a very early release of JSYNC, and should not be used at all
    unless you know what you are doing.

    Supported so far: - dump and load of the basic JSON model - dump and
    load of duplicate references - dump and load recursive references - dump
    and load typed mappings and sequences - escaping of special keys and
    values - dump globs - add json pretty printing
